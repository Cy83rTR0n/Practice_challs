Step 1:
  .When opened the given pdf we will see some message:"welcome to inctf finals,hope you solve this challenge fastest."
  .This message doesnot seem to be useful.
  .So lets try binwalk tool and check if any file is embedded in it.
  .Now you will find a .7z zip file within it.
Step 2:
  .By extracting files in it, we get omg.pdf
  .We find there is nothing inside the file but we can see that some text is highlighted when we use Ctrl+a. 
    Text: What is Steganography ?Steganography is an amaz ?Sg
  .So we can understand steganography is there in this file.
  .As the name suggest, this might be snow steg.
Step 3:
  .For understanding snowsteg we prefer http://www.darkside.com.au/snow/
  .By applying snow steg on this pdf we will be able to get flag.
