Step 1:
  .With the ggiven image and audio we have to analyse if any data is useful for us.
  .Intially we should apply tool called "Stegsolve" on that image provided.
  .Then we will get some key :"1518"
Step 2:
  .Now we should apply "Stego magic" tool on audio provided.
  .It ask you to store the decrypted data in a file.
  .After creating that file,It will ask us for key for decryption.
  .As we know a key we can give 1518 as key.
  .We will get a pdf file through decryption.
Step 3:
  .Applying binwalk on this pdf shows you a png file is encrypted in it.
  .On opening the png file, we get a qr code.
Step 4:
  .Now by decrypting this qr code we will get some weird text.
  .This weird text is a malbolge text.
  .This malbolge code again doesnot make any sense.
  .So we have to reverse whole text obtained and execute it with a malbolge online compiler.
  .This executed code finally ends up giving the flag.
  flag:"inctf{M1xiNg_uP_4udio_Qr_4nD_A_W3ird_L4ngu4ge_1s_So_L0vely}"
